        <strong>Hercules</strong> (/ˈhɜːrkjʊˌliːz/, US: /-kjə-/)[2] is the
        Roman equivalent of the Greek divine hero Heracles, son of Jupiter and the mortal Alcmene. In classical mythology, Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures. 
        <div style="margin: 10px 0px;"></div>
        The Romans
        adapted the Greek hero's iconography and myths for their literature
        and art under the name Hercules. In later Western art and literature
        and in popular culture, Hercules is more commonly used than Heracles
        as the name of the hero. Hercules is a multifaceted figure with
        contradictory characteristics, which enabled later artists and writers
        to pick and choose how to represent him.[3] This article provides an
        introduction to representations of Hercules in the later tradition.

        In Roman mythology, although Hercules was seen as the champion of the
        weak and a great protector, his personal problems started at birth.
        Juno sent two witches to prevent the birth, but they were tricked by
        one of Alcmene's servants and sent to another room. Juno then sent
        serpents to kill him in his cradle, but Hercules strangled them both.
        In one version of the myth, Alcmene abandoned her baby in the woods in
        order to protect him from Juno's wrath, but he was found by the
        goddess Minerva who brought him to Juno, claiming he was an orphan
        child left in the woods who needed nourishment. Juno suckled Hercules
        at her own breast until the infant bit her nipple, at which point she
        pushed him away, spilling her milk across the night sky and so forming
        the Milky Way. She then gave the infant back to Minerva and told her
        to take care of the baby herself. In feeding the child from her own
        breast, the goddess inadvertently imbued him with further strength and
        power.

        <p>
          <div class="indented-link">Main article: <a href="#">Labours of Hercules</a></div>
           Hercules is known for his many
          adventures, which took him to the far reaches of the Greco-Roman
          world. One cycle of these adventures became canonical as the "Twelve Labours", but the list has variations.
          One traditional order of the labours is found in the Bibliotheca as follows:[4]
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>Slay the Nemean Lion.</li>
            <li>Slay the nine-headed Lernaean Hydra.</li>
            <li>Capture the Golden Hind of Artemis.</li>
            <li>Capture the Erymanthian Boar.</li>
            <li>Clean the Augean stables in a single day.</li>
            <li>Slay the Stymphalian Birds.</li>
            <li>Capture the Cretan Bull.</li>
            <li>Steal the Mares of Diomedes.</li>
            <li>Obtain the girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons.</li>
            <li>Obtain the cattle of the monster Geryon.</li>
            <li>Steal the apples of the Hesperides.</li>
            <li>Capture and bring back Cerberus.</li>

        <p id="sideadventures" class="chapter-undertitle">Side adventures</p>
        <p>

          Hercules had a greater number of "deeds on the side" (parerga) that
          have been popular subjects for art, including:

          The Latin name Hercules was borrowed through Etruscan, where it is
          represented variously as Heracle, Hercle, and other forms. Hercules
          was a favorite subject for Etruscan art, and appears often on bronze
          mirrors. The Etruscan form Herceler derives from the Greek Heracles
          via syncope. A mild oath invoking Hercules (Hercule! or Mehercle!)
          was a common interjection in Classical Latin.[5]</p>
          
          <p class="text-block">
          Hercules had a
          number of myths that were distinctly Roman. One of these is
          Hercules' defeat of Cacus, who was terrorizing the countryside of
          Rome. The hero was associated with the Aventine Hill through his son
          Aventinus. Mark Antony considered him a personal patron god, as did
          the emperor Commodus. Hercules received various forms of religious
          veneration, including as a deity concerned with children and
          childbirth, in part because of myths about his precocious infancy,
          and in part because he fathered countless children. Roman brides
          wore a special belt tied with the "knot of Hercules", which was
          supposed to be hard to untie.[6] The comic playwright Plautus
          presents the myth of Hercules' conception as a sex comedy in his
          play Amphitryon; Seneca wrote the tragedy Hercules Furens about his
          bout with madness. During the Roman Imperial era, Hercules was
          worshipped locally from Hispania through Gaul.

          Tacitus records a special affinity of the Germanic peoples for
          Hercules. In chapter 3 of his Germania, Tacitus states:
        <p class="quote">... they say
          that Hercules, too, once visited them; and when going into battle,
          they sang of him first of all heroes. They have also those songs of
          theirs, by the recital of this barditus[7] as they call it, they
          rouse their courage, while from the note they augur the result of
          the approaching conflict. For, as their line shouts, they inspire or
          feel alarm.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
        Some have taken this as Tacitus equating the Germanic
        Þunraz with Hercules by way of interpretatio romana.[8] 
      </p>
      <p class="text-block">
        In the Roman
        era Hercules' Club amulets appear from the 2nd to 3rd century,
        distributed over the empire (including Roman Britain, c.f. Cool
        1986), mostly made of gold, shaped like wooden clubs. A specimen
        found in Köln-Nippes bears the inscription "DEO HER[culi]",
        confirming the association with Hercules. </p>
        
        <p class="text-block">
        In the 5th to 7th
        centuries, during the Migration Period, the amulet is theorized to
        have rapidly spread from the Elbe Germanic area across Europe. These
        Germanic "Donar's Clubs" were made from deer antler, bone or wood,
        more rarely also from bronze or precious metals. The amulet type is
        replaced by the Viking Age Thor's hammer pendants in the course of
        the Christianization of Scandinavia from the 8th to 9th century.

        <p class="text-block">After the Roman Empire became Christianized, mythological narratives were often reinterpreted as allegory,
          influenced by the philosophy of late antiquity. In the 4th century, Servius had described Hercules' return
          from the underworld as representing his ability to overcome earthly desires and vices, or the earth itself as
          a consumer of bodies.[9] In medieval mythography, Hercules was one of the heroes seen as a strong role model
          who demonstrated both valor and wisdom, while the monsters he battles were regarded as moral obstacles.[10]
          One glossator noted that when Hercules became a constellation, he showed that strength was necessary to gain
          entrance to Heaven.[11]</p>

        <p class="text-block">Medieval mythography was written almost entirely in Latin, and original Greek texts were little used as
          sources for Hercules' myths.</p>

          The Renaissance and the invention of the printing press brought a renewed interest in and publication of Greek
          literature. Renaissance mythography drew more extensively on the Greek tradition of Heracles, typically under
          the Romanized name Hercules, or the alternate name Alcides. In a chapter of his book Mythologiae (1567), the
          influential mythographer Natale Conti collected and summarized an extensive range of myths concerning the
          birth, adventures, and death of the hero under his Roman name Hercules. Conti begins his lengthy chapter on
          Hercules with an overview description that continues the moralizing impulse of the Middle Ages:

        <p class="quote">
          Hercules, who subdued and destroyed monsters, bandits, and criminals, was justly famous and renowned for his
          great courage. His great and glorious reputation was worldwide, and so firmly entrenched that he'll always be
          remembered. In fact the ancients honored him with his own temples, altars, ceremonies, and priests. But it was
          his wisdom and great soul that earned those honors; noble blood, physical strength, and political power just
          aren't good enough.[12]

        <p>In 1600, the citizens of Avignon bestowed on Henry of Navarre (the future King Henry IV of France) the title
          of the Hercule Gaulois ("Gallic Hercules"), justifying the extravagant flattery with a genealogy that traced
          the origin of the House of Navarre to a nephew of Hercules' son Hispalus.[13]</p>

        <p id="roadofhercules" class="chapter-undertitle">Road of Hercules</p>
        <p>The Road of Hercules is a route across Southern Gaul that is associated with the path Hercules took during
          his 10th labor of retrieving the Cattle of Geryon from the Red Isles.[14] Hannibal took the same path on his
          march towards Italy and encouraged the belief that he was the second Hercules.[14] Primary sources often make
          comparisons between Hercules and Hannibal.[14] Hannibal further tried to invoke parallels between himself and
          Hercules by starting his march on Italy by visiting the shrine of Hercules at Gades. While crossing the alps,
          he performed labors in a heroic manner. A famous example was noted by Livy, when Hannibal fractured the side
          of a cliff that was blocking his march.[14]</p>

        <p id="worshipofwomen" class="chapter-undertitle">Worship from women</p>
        <p>In ancient Roman society women were usually limited to two types of cults: those that addressed feminine
          matters such as childbirth, and cults that required virginal chastity.[15] However, there is evidence
          suggesting there were female worshippers of Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Hercules.[15] Some scholars believe
          that women were completely prohibited from any of Hercules's cults. Others believe it was only the "Ara
          Maxima" at which they were not allowed to worship.[15] Macrobius in his first book of Saturnalia paraphrases
          from Varro: "For when Hercules was bringing the cattle of Geryon through Italy, a woman replied to the thirsty
          hero that she could not give him water because it was the day of the Goddess Women and it was unlawful for a
          man to taste what had been prepared for her. Hercules, therefore, when he was about to offer a sacrifice
          forbid the presence of women and ordered Potitius and Pinarius who where in charge of his rites, not to allow
          any women from taking part".[15] Macrobius states that women were restricted in their participation in
          Hercules cults, but to what extent remains ambiguous. He mentions that women were not allowed to participate
          in Sacrum which is general term used to describe anything that was believed to have belonged to the gods. This
          could include anything from a precious item to a temple. Due to the general nature of a Sacrum, we can not
          judge the extent of the prohibition from Macrobius alone.[15] There are also ancient writings on this topic
          from Aulus Gellius when speaking on how Romans swore oaths. He mentioned that Roman women do not swear on
          Hercules, nor do Roman men swear on Castor.[15] He went on to say that women refrain from sacrificing to
          Hercules.[15] Propertius in his poem 4.9 also mentions similar information as Macrobius. This is evidence that
          he was also using Varro as a source.[15]
        </p>

        <p id="worshipinmyth" class="chapter-undertitle">Worship in myth</p>
        <p class="text-block">There is evidence of Hercules worship in myth in the Latin epic poem, the Aeneid. In the 8th book of the poem
          Aeneas finally reaches the future site of Rome, where he meets Evander and the Arcadians making sacrifices to
          Hercules on the banks of the Tiber river.[16] They share a feast, and Evander tells the story of how Hercules
          defeated the monster Cascus, and describes him as a triumphant hero.[16] Translated from the Latin text of
          Vergil, Evander stated: "Time brought to us in our time of need the aid and arrival of a god. For there came
          that mightiest avenger, the victor Hercules, proud with the slaughter and the spoils of threefold Geryon, and
          he drove the mighty bulls here, and the cattle filled both valley and riverside.[16]
        </p>

        <p class="text-block">Hercules was also mentioned in the Fables of Gaius Julius Hyginus. For example, in his fable about
          Philoctetes he tells the story of how Philoctetes built a funeral pyre for Hercules so his body could be
          consumed and raised to immortality.[17]
        </p>


        <p id="herculesandtheroman" class="chapter-undertitle">Hercules and the Roman triumph</p>
        <p>According to Livy (9.44.16) Romans were commemorating military victories by building statues to Hercules as
          early as 305 BCE. Also, philosopher Pliny the Elder dates Hercules worship back to the time of Evander, by
          accrediting him with erecting a statue in the Forum Boarium of Hercules.[18] Scholars agree that there would
          have been 5–7 temples in Augustan Rome.[18] There are believed to be related Republican triumphatores,
          however, not necessarily triumphal dedications. There is two temples located in the Campus Martius. One, being
          the Temple of Hercules Musarum, dedicated between 187 and 179 BCE by M. Fulvius Nobilior.[18] And the other
          being the Temple of Hercules Custos, likely renovated by Sulla in the 80s BCE.[18]

        <p id="inart" class="chapter-undertitle">In art</p>
        <p class="text-block">In Roman works of art and in Renaissance and post-Renaissance art, Hercules can be identified by his
          attributes, the lion skin and the gnarled club (his favorite weapon); in mosaic he is shown tanned bronze, a
          virile aspect.[19]
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">In the twentieth century, the Farnese Hercules has inspired artists such as Jeff Koons, Matthew Darbyshire
          and Robert Mapplethorpe to reinterpret Hercules for new audiences.[20] The choice of deliberately white
          materials by Koons and Darbyshire has been interpreted as perpetuation of colourism in how the classical world
          is viewed.[20] Mapplethorpe's work with black model Derrick Cross can be seen as a reaction to neo-classical
          colourism, resisting the portrayal of Hercules as white.[20]</p>

          <p>Hercules was among the earliest figures on ancient Roman coinage, and has been the main motif of many collector coins and medals since. One example is the Austrian 20 euro Baroque Silver coin issued on September 11, 2002. The obverse side of the coin shows the Grand Staircase in the town palace of Prince Eugene of Savoy in Vienna, currently the Austrian Ministry of Finance. Gods and demi-gods hold its flights, while Hercules stands at the turn of the stairs.</p>

          <p class="text-block">A series of nineteen Italian Hercules movies were made in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The actors who played Hercules in these films were Steve Reeves, Gordon Scott, Kirk Morris, Mickey Hargitay, Mark Forest, Alan Steel, Dan Vadis, Brad Harris, Reg Park, Peter Lupus (billed as Rock Stevens) and Michael Lane. A number of English-dubbed Italian films that featured the name of Hercules in their title were not intended to be movies about Hercules.</p>
